                        <h4>Nashville Software School<br><span class="subhead"> Nashville, TN - Jan-June 2018</span></h4>

                        <p><strong>Front-end developer and UX/UI Design apprentice</strong>  
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>My journey began as an apprentice at Nashville Software School (NSS) where I was immersed in a six-month long, full-time software development bootcamp focusing on front-end development and UI/UX design fundamentals. NSS's apprenticeship experience involved daily hands on application of front-end development fundamentals and design principles through group and individual projects reflecting real world business problems.</p>

                        <p> We applied source code version control with Git/GitHub as well as utilized GitHub Projects and Issue Tracking for project management. We implemented JavaScript fundamentals leveraging DRY, modular, readable code, and reusable components. Built single-page applications in the React framework leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Utilized task automation with Grunt: Linting with JSHint, module bundling with Browserify, SASS compilation. Styled applications with the CSS framework Bootstrap as well as writing custom styles with SASS, CSS Grid and Flexbox. Deployed applications through Firebase and GitHub Pages.</p>
                            
                        <p>UX and UI design training involves creating user stories based on assessment of user experience and workflow to produce visual and interactive design with strategic use of typography, layout, color, motion, and behavior. Created interactive story ideas and complex interactions with wireframes or prototypes.</p>
